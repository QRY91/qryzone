# Introduction
---

There is a lot of very specific and very opinionated content surrounding the topic of physical fitness. That's a little odd, because the governing principles are not that complicated. 

--- 
## Core principles
---

### Survival

We need to be alive in order to train (ideally). To survive, we need **water**, **food**, and **rest**. So the baseline for building a productive training plan starts with these elements.

Survival requirements
- water
- food 
- rest

### Body composition 

To **gain mass**, we need a **caloric surplus**. To **lose mass**, we need a **caloric deficit**.
Surplus and deficit are relative to the [basal metabolic rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) (i.e.: the amount of energy our body expends maintaining itself).

We can further specify mass in terms of **body weight** (BW), which in turn consists of **lean body mass** (LBM) + **body fat** (BF). In the context of body composition, there are some important basics to consider.

*Firstly*, doing stomach exercises will not burn more fat from your stomach. Frustratingly, we cannot directly **"target"** a body part for fat loss in such a way. The mechanism by which fat is stored and how it is used within the body is largely controlled by **genetics**, meaning that the areas of your body where fat is stored are not affected by which areas you exercise. However, performing sufficient exercise to raise total energy **expenditure** above caloric **intake** will still reduce body fat, which will eventually lead to less fat on your stomach, though indirectly.

*Secondly*, making a muscle group work **hard** will stimulate it, leading the body to respond by spending some of its resources towards growing those muscles. Importantly, we must guarantee the **quality** of the stimulus as well as its **frequency**. Lifting the same amount of weight for years will do nothing to progress fitness goals, and is only useful in the context of **maintainance**. To achieve muscle **growth**, we must challenge ourselves during every workout.

*Thirdly*, the lack of a stimulus to a muscle group will eventually lead to muscle **atrophy** if it is not actively being maintained. **"Use it, or lose it."** This is how a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to a number of health issues later in life, such as reduced mobility.

*In summary*, fat loss/gain is entirely dependent on calorie intake vs expenditure. Muscle growth is reliant on both quality and frequency of stimuli. Atrophy occurs when muscles do not receive adequate stimuli/resources for extended periods of time.

### Training
If we add our knowledge of body composition to the previously discussed survival requirements, we can see that we're only really adding a single new element: exercise.

Training requirements
- water
- food
- rest
- **exercise**

Because so much of fitness relies on core pillars of survival, getting fit often requires a change in **lifestyle** as opposed to simply following along with a cookie-cutter exercise routine. Now that we understand the basics, we are ready to put that knowledge to use so that we can achieve our goals.

## Goals
---
### Situation
As a programmer, I lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle, which takes its toll on my wrist mobility (typing) & hip mobility (sitting), as well as providing little opportunity for cardiovascular activity or improving strength as part of my professional responsibilities. Good work practices such as stretching can only get you so far, so outside of work, I'd also like to build some muscle and improve my strength and mobility, so that I can continue to use my body to its full potential as I age.

To prevent further deterioration of my physical health, it would be best to start exercising regularly (though it'd have been better to start years ago). 

### Analysis
Let's look at how we can turn these goals into actionable items.

Some examples of common fitness goals for beginners:
- Losing weight
- Gaining muscle
- Looking great at the beach
- Training for a marathon
- Improving mobility 

This is where a categorical approach can start to be useful, to narrow down what sort of exercises we should be performing to achieve our goals. The 3 big domains are Strength, Mobility, and Cardio. Generally, you want at least a little bit of each to maintain good physical health. But the amount of each differs based on your own fitness goals.

In some cases, a certain type of exercise may actually impede or slow down progress towards your main goal, due to our body's response to each type of activity. After all, lifting heavy weight is great for improving strength, but if your goal is to run a marathon, you may benefit from spending more time running instead.

Personally, I feel like I have an underdeveloped body for my age, and I could be a lot stronger physically. I've also been experiencing stiffness in my joints, and chronic pain in my wrists and neck. As a scrawny nerd, I am typically underweight, and I don't have much of an interest in endurance beyond maintaining a healthy baseline, so weight loss and cardio are low on my list of priorities. So my goals would look something like this.

Personal goals:
- Gaining muscle
- Improving mobility

Great! So now we've established what we are training for, and we are ready to proceed by determining the frequency of each type of training.

### Schedule
I want a schedule that I can maintain throughout my life regardless of circumstances, so that it is easier for me to stay consistent with my training as a beginner. For this reason, I've decided to leave my weekends open, and to limit my workouts to 3 times a week, in alternating sequence of "on" and "off". 

So my "on" days (Y) are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with "off" days (N) on Tuesday, and Thursday.
