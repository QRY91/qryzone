This is a statically generated blog built with Zola. I've been exploring ways of taking notes, playing with Rust, and generally improving my knowledge about web development in a hands-on way. I needed support for markdown so that I can easily copy over my notes or use them elsewhere (meaning pure HTML would not be suitable for this purpose). 

Zola is an SSG in Rust, so that is a good way to get familiar with the programming language while I figure out how to actually write notes in an organised way. I'd like to deepen my understanding of the internal linking features as well as tagging and categories, so that I can add some structure to these pages. But for now, it remains a jumbled mess of documents and code, which is kind of fun in its own way!
