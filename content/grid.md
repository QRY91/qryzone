# Introduction
---

The unnamed 4X game is going to need a map to explore and spawn units on. I know nothing about how to implement such a thing, so today's goal is to learn as much as possible. 

I'm not sure if I want to dive straight into making a hex based map from the start, as it seems more complex than using simple squares. Based on my experience playing games in the genre, I do honestly prefer hexagons, with some exceptions (e.g.: [Into The Breach](https://subsetgames.com/itb.html)).
