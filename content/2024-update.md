## Where I've been
Been a while! I've been focused on my education in recent months, but the material is currently not sufficiently challenging. Predictably, this negatively impacts my focus and general emotional wellbeing, so I'll be spinning up some side-projects to keep myself engaged and growing.

## What I'm up to
For this purpose, I've finally pulled the trigger on registering a domain name (qry.zone), and will be configuring hosting soon as well. I'd like to make more of an effort to share my experiments, projects, and thoughts in an indirect manner. I should try to improve my writing skills, and incorporate other ways of communicating as well.

## What I'm going for
I'd like a space where I can be messy, where I can let others into my process. I won't be spending much effort on keeping things particularily orderly, my focus is mostly learning how to be consistently productive in ways that align with my personal goals. This place is a way to explore that journey.
