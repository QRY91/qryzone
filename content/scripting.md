One of the things I really dislike about video tutorials is having to repeatedly go back to something that you just kind of missed so you have to continuously hear that same way of phrasing it.

I keep having to switch back and forth between what I'm doing and what the tutorial is doing and managing these things at the same time. Maybe I just want to be listening to my own music and just have the video on mute and still follow along. Maybe I want to leave the video paused as a reference while I work. What I'm going for is that you have your own choice of how you consume the tutorial content.

To achieve this, there should be a visual, a transcription, and a voiceover. All three of those should work together so that as you’re scrubbing back and forth through the video you never get lost. Every segment of the tutorial should stand on its own. If you pause it, the visual and transcript should work as an infographic. If you look away, the voiceover on its own should work as an instructional. If you mute it, the video should show you what to do, and the transcript should explain what can’t be shown.

There's two main tools I use when writing scripts. To record and edit text I use Google Docs, and to record audio I use Audacity.

My main way of drafting a script is using the Voice Typing feature in Google Docs. The advantage of working this way is that I get to write in the way that I actually think. Creatively speaking, it's very liberating to be able to just talk about something in a way where I get to flow and then do the editing afterwards, which in turn helps me to actually release content without getting overwhelmed. So this is probably the way I'll be working moving forward and I'm really happy to have found a method that seems to work for me. It will be a massive timesaver to create a written draft of the script, along with a rough voiceover, all at the same time! 

I don't really want to do the typical YouTuber thing where I sit in front of a camera and ramble, I don't really think that adds much to the experience. I'm more focused on delivering content in a way that is engaging and to-the-point. I do think it’s important to have some amount of a personal touch where you can at least hear my voice (if you want to), so that you can have more of a human connection there, as opposed to being reduced to a disembodied block of text with visuals.

I don't necessarily need to do the voiceover while I'm also clicking around. I think it might be better to record myself doing the action separately from the voiceover.
