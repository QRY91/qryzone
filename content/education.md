Ideally, I would ask more questions than I can answer. In order for this to be useful, however, I must share my questions so that, if I am unable to provide an answer, other can take up the query and try to solve it themselves. I'm quite curious by nature, so generatiing questions takes no effort at all. By writing them down, I am able to ponder these questions in public, and share them with others. This way, I should be able to learn a lot more efficiently than if I were to keep all my thoughts to myself. Partly, the mere act of writing the thoughts down allows better awareness of my inner focus.
