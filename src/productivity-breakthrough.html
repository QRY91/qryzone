        <p>
            I spent years studying game systems - min-maxing builds, breaking dialogue trees, finding edge cases in game logic. Turns out that's useful for software development. Who knew.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shift happened when I stopped consuming and started building. Gaming became less interesting. Hacking things together became more interesting. Not because I forced it - something just changed.

            AI lowered the barrier
        </h2>
        <p>
            AI tools helped bypass the tutorial hell that used to kill my momentum. Instead of spending weeks on setup and configuration, I could jump straight to the interesting problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure, we go off the cliff like lemmings sometimes. But I'm having fun all the way down. The experimentation became the point, not the obstacle.

            The evidence
        </h2>
        <p>
            My <a href="https://github.com/QRY91" style="color: var(--color-accent);">GitHub activity</a> spiked once I started using AI more intensively. Ideas I'd had floating around for ages suddenly became buildable. The threshold for experimentation dropped to nearly zero.
        </p>
        <p>
            A contribution graph is easy to manipulate - I could write my name if I wanted. But the sudden change was worth noting. Something shifted.

            What transferred
        </h2>
        <p>
            Breaking down complex systems. Recognizing patterns. Grinding through iteration. Working through challenges until they click. The same skills I used to optimize game builds, applied to building software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The drive is mostly intrinsic now. I build because it's interesting, not because I'm supposed to.
