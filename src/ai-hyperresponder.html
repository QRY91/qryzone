        The analogy
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        In fitness, there's a concept called an anabolic hyperresponder. Two people follow the same program, same diet, same recovery. One gets normal results. The other puts on muscle at twice the rate. Same inputs. Different wiring.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Same thing happens with AI. Everyone has access to the same models, the same APIs, the same documentation. Most people get modest productivity gains. Some people catch fire.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I'm trying to figure out why. Partly because I think I might be one, and partly because I don't trust that conclusion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        Reckless artist, ruthless editor
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The dynamic that works for me: I throw out half-formed ideas, associations, weird connections between unrelated things. The AI catches them, structures them, finds the thread I was reaching for. I break rules. It follows rules. Together we cover ground neither of us could alone.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I'll say something like "this monitoring tool should work like a dog that barks at strangers but knows the mailman." That's useless as a spec. But Claude turns it into a concrete architecture where known patterns get filtered and anomalies get flagged. The metaphor carried more information than a requirements document would have.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Reckless artist, ruthless editor. I provide the creative leaps and the half-baked intuitions. The AI provides disciplined execution and the patience to actually implement them properly. Most people try to use AI as the creative partner. I think that's backwards (for me, anyway). The AI is the contractor. I'm the weird client with strong opinions and bad drawings.
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The wiring
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Here's where it gets personal. My brain doesn't do linear. Never has. Conversations jump. Ideas arrive sideways. I'll be thinking about database schemas and suddenly connect it to something I read about ant colonies six months ago, and that connection is actually useful, but only if someone (or something) can catch it and do the disciplined work of turning it into code.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        That's the ADHD pattern-matching thing. You see connections between distant concepts faster than most people. The trade-off is you can't always execute on them because your attention is already somewhere else. AI fills that gap. I spot the pattern. The model builds the bridge. Before AI, half these connections just evaporated because I'd move on before finishing the implementation.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        And the hyperfocus &mdash; when an AI session is working well, when the dynamic is clicking, I can go six hours without noticing. That's not discipline. That's the collaboration producing enough novelty and feedback to keep the attention system locked on. A solo coding session might lose me in 45 minutes. An AI-assisted session where we're building something new? I forget to eat.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I'm not claiming ADHD is a superpower. It's mostly a pain in the ass. But it turns out the specific deficits (linear execution, sustained attention on routine tasks, finishing things) map almost perfectly onto what AI is good at. The fit isn't "AI fixes me." The fit is complementary dysfunction.

        The arcade machine
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I have a 600+ game Steam library. Haven't touched it in months. Development with AI gives me the same dopamine loop &mdash; immediate feedback, escalating challenge, the feeling of getting better at the meta-game &mdash; but it produces real things. Tools. Websites. Knowledge. Things that exist tomorrow morning.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Each AI interaction is a coin in the machine. Prompt, response, evaluate, adjust, prompt again. The cycle is fast enough to keep the attention system engaged and slow enough to require actual thinking. It's the perfect difficulty curve: hard enough to be interesting, scaffolded enough to not be paralyzing.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        And it compounds. Getting better at prompting makes the AI more useful. Building tools makes the workflow faster. The meta-game (improving how you work with AI) is itself engaging enough to sustain focus. Work becomes play. Learning either way. Need another coin for the productivity arcade.
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The shadow side
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        So what happens when the API goes down and you've forgotten how to think without it?
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        That's the question I keep circling. If AI amplifies my capabilities, am I building real skills or just a dependency with extra steps? When I hit token limits mid-refactor and the AI goes silent, can I still finish the thought? (Sometimes yes. Sometimes I stare at the screen for twenty minutes before remembering how to read documentation like a normal person.)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The hyperresponder framing sounds flattering but it might just be a fancy word for "person whose brain got hijacked by a new dopamine source." My Steam library gathered dust because games couldn't compete with the feedback loop anymore. What if I'm not a hyperresponder? What if I'm just addicted to a particularly productive kind of slot machine?
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        And the toolchain I'm building &mdash; uroboro, sjiek, wherewasi, all of it &mdash; optimizes the collaboration loop. Makes it faster, smoother, less friction. That's either intelligent meta-work or building a shinier cage. I genuinely don't know which.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The honest answer is probably both. The productivity is real. The dependency is real. The skills I'm developing (system design, prompt engineering, meta-tooling) have value even if the specific tools change. But the claim that AI "amplifies" rather than "replaces" my capabilities needs constant testing, not comfortable repetition.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Same tools. Different results. I think the difference is cognitive fit, not effort or intelligence. Some brains are wired for the collaboration dynamic and some aren't. That's not a hierarchy &mdash; it's a variable.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        But I wouldn't bet my career on that theory without keeping one eye on the exit.
