        <p>
            Social media not only commodifies self-expression, it invents attachment to brainfarts.
            Thoughts we would otherwise never publish become an outward expression of our individuality,
            by way of our least interesting, but most nonsensical impulses.
        </p>

        <p>
            It optimizes for tones of zany, edgy, and/or snarky. Because those are good for engagement.
            Are those thoughts our most important?

        <h2>The permanence problem</h2>
        <p>
            Another concern is the semi-permanence of these otherwise ethereal thoughts. Any old
            shitpost stays up for years. Not to mention how much actual human attention all this
            content is absorbing.
