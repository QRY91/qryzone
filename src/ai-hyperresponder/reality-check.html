        The question
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The parent article makes a claim. "I think I might be one." Then hedges it. "I don't trust that conclusion." Then spends two thousand words building the case anyway &mdash; the ADHD fit, the arcade machine dopamine loop, the complementary dysfunction framing. All vibes. No receipts.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        So here are the receipts.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I have nine months of git history across personal and professional repos. I have 1,649 uroboro captures logging decisions, blockers, and open questions. I have a satirical tool called <a href="https://github.com/QRY91/keygrave" style="color: var(--color-accent)">keygrave</a> that parses my Claude Code session data and tells me exactly how often I just press Enter without thinking.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        What would a hyperresponder's data look like? Sustained high output, deliberate tool use, genuine skill transfer. What would a dependency's data look like? Output that collapses without AI, mechanical approval patterns, no evidence of independent thought. Let's see which story the numbers tell.
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The commits
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        948 commits since May 2025. That's personal projects and professional client work combined, filtered to only my authorship. Not counting the commits where I stripped the Co-Authored-By Claude tags because they felt like a confession I wasn't ready to make. (The data's dirty. I made it dirty. Note that.)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The naive read on personal projects looks damning. 205 commits in June, then a cliff: 18 in July, zero in August, 4 in September. Five months of near-silence. That's not a hyperresponder. That's a hypomanic episode with a comedown.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Pull the camera back. The professional repos tell a different story. While personal projects went quiet, client work ramped: 48 commits in September, 205 in October across four simultaneous engagements. The energy didn't vanish. It shifted domain. Bechtle. Kepler. Foodflou. The work that pays the mortgage absorbed the work that feeds the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Combined monthly picture: 63, 205, 18, 4, 52, 205, 34, 14, 178, 175. Two genuine peaks (June and October), two genuine valleys (August and December), and a January-February surge that's still running. Not sustained. Not collapsed. Cyclical. The peaks hit hard and the valleys are real, but the machine keeps restarting.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        What the commits don't show: how many of those lines were written by me versus generated by Claude and approved with a keystroke. I stripped the attribution. The git log looks like a solo developer's output, but it wasn't solo. Every number here has an asterisk I put there myself.
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The decisions
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        384 documented technical decisions in uroboro. Each one follows the format: what I chose, what I rejected, why. "Zero external dependencies over convenience libraries &mdash; control and auditability." "SQLite over Postgres &mdash; single file, no daemon, portable." "CLI-first over web UI &mdash; composable, scriptable, no browser dependency."
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        That format isn't something a vibe-coder does. You don't record what you rejected if you never considered alternatives. The decision trail shows deliberate choices with trade-offs weighed. Across 54 projects. Across multiple programming languages and problem domains.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        But. The formal tagging only started in January 2026. Seven weeks of discipline, not nine months. Before that, uroboro captured raw notes &mdash; verbose, untagged, useful for archaeology but not for analysis. The June 2025 data is 586 captures from building uroboro itself, which is recursive in a way that makes the data unreliable. (Building the measurement tool generates measurement artifacts. Who knew.)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        What the decisions do show, even in seven weeks: patterns that recur across unrelated projects. Zero-dependency preference in Go, in bash, in site architecture. SQLite as the coordination layer everywhere. CLI-first interfaces even when a web UI would be easier to demo. These aren't AI defaults. Claude would happily reach for Express or React or whatever fits. These are human preferences the AI learned to follow.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        15 blockers. 12 open questions. The blocker count is suspiciously low &mdash; either I rarely get stuck or I rarely bother to record it. Knowing myself: the second one.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The approval rate
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Here's the part where the simple narrative dies.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I built keygrave as a joke. A fake corporate telemetry enrollment screen that parses your actual Claude Code session data and outputs real numbers dressed in dystopian aesthetics. "You are the product. Thank you for your participation. This data has not been transmitted. (That you know of.)"
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The joke stopped being funny when the numbers came back.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        29,038 approvals. Zero rejections. I have never once explicitly told Claude Code "no." Not in 288 sessions. Not across 43 projects. Not in 1.1 gigabytes of conversation data. Of those 29,038 approvals, 29,009 were automatic tool accepts &mdash; Claude proposes an action, I press Enter. Only 29 times did I type an actual response to a tool request.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        94.3% of my inputs are functionally pressing a single key. Keygrave calls it "CCK-3 Compatibility" &mdash; as in, how compatible are you with Claudetite Keyz, the satirical three-key keyboard. Turns out I only need one of the three.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Average time between Claude's output and my next input: 7.6 seconds. Longest hesitation: 299 seconds &mdash; five minutes, once, across the entire dataset. The rest of the time it's under ten seconds. That's not "carefully evaluating each proposed change." That's a reflex.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        So. 384 documented decisions with alternatives weighed. And 29,038 approvals with zero pushback. Both true. Same person. Same timeframe.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The pattern
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The data doesn't say "hyperresponder." The data doesn't say "dependent." The data says something messier that doesn't fit either label.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        It says: output that cycles between intense bursts and genuine valleys, professional work filling personal gaps, deliberate architectural decisions embedded in a workflow of near-automatic approval, and a tool usage pattern that grew 6x in four months. Someone who documents what they choose and why, but never says no to the machine that executes it. Someone who built the tool to measure the dependency, got uncomfortable with the answer, and wrote about it anyway.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The 384 decisions and the 29,038 approvals aren't contradictions. They're two layers of the same workflow. The decisions happen at the architectural level &mdash; what to build, which patterns to follow, what trade-offs to accept. The approvals happen at the execution level &mdash; write this file, run this command, make this edit. I think at one altitude. The AI executes at another. I never say no at the execution level because by the time it's executing, the real decision already happened.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Or that's what I tell myself. The alternative reading: I'm rationalizing a rubber-stamp reflex as "high-level decision-making." The 7.6 seconds isn't evaluation time. It's the time it takes to move my finger to the Enter key. The decisions in uroboro are post-hoc narratives, not real-time deliberation.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Can't tell which from inside.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        948 commits. 384 decisions. 29,038 approvals. Zero rejections. 94.3% single-key inputs. 7.6 seconds of what might be thought.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Am I a hyperresponder? The honest answer: I produce real output across real domains with real clients paying real money. The output is cyclical, not sustained. The AI does most of the typing. I do most of the steering. Whether that steering is genuine or illusory depends on whether you trust my uroboro captures more than my keygrave numbers.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I built keygrave to measure this. I built uroboro to capture the decisions. I'm now writing an article that interrogates both. That's either genuine self-awareness or performative self-awareness dressed up as honesty. Three layers of meta-examination, each one potentially another way to avoid the actual question.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The data is here. Make your own call.
