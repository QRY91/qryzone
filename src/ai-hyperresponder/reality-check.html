        The question
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The parent article makes a claim. "I think I might be one." Then hedges it. "I don't trust that conclusion." Then spends two thousand words building the case anyway &mdash; the ADHD fit, the arcade machine dopamine loop, the complementary dysfunction framing. All vibes. No receipts.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        So here are the receipts.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I have nine months of git history across personal and professional repos. I have 1,649 uroboro captures logging decisions, blockers, and open questions. I have a satirical tool called <a href="https://github.com/QRY91/keygrave" style="color: var(--color-accent)">keygrave</a> that parses my Claude Code session data and spits out the exact kind of metrics that people use to draw conclusions they already wanted to reach.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        What would a hyperresponder's data look like? What would a dependency's data look like? Trick question. The same data tells both stories depending on what you walked in wanting to believe. But let's look anyway.
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The commits
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        948 commits since May 2025. Personal projects and professional client work combined, filtered to my authorship. I stripped the Co-Authored-By Claude tags from most of them &mdash; not because I was hiding anything, but because people were rejecting working code the moment they saw the attribution. Tribalism. The code either works or it doesn't. "Committed by JetBrains Rider (50% off premium!)" &mdash; we don't do this for any other tool. Why are we doing it for this one?
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The naive read on personal projects looks damning. 205 commits in June, then a cliff: 18 in July, zero in August, 4 in September. Five months of near-silence. That's not a hyperresponder. That's a hypomanic episode with a comedown.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Pull the camera back. The professional repos tell a different story. While personal projects went quiet, client work ramped: 48 commits in September, 205 in October across four simultaneous engagements. The energy didn't vanish. It shifted domain. Bechtle. Kepler. Foodflou. The work that pays the mortgage absorbed the work that feeds the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Combined monthly picture: 63, 205, 18, 4, 52, 205, 34, 14, 178, 175. Two genuine peaks (June and October), two genuine valleys (August and December), and a January-February surge that's still running. Not sustained. Not collapsed. Cyclical. The peaks hit hard and the valleys are real, but the machine keeps restarting.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        What the commits don't show: how many of those lines were typed by me versus generated by Claude. But here's the thing &mdash; I'm not sure that question matters as much as people want it to. This is the automation industry. THE automation industry. We build tools that make human labor less necessary. Then we get precious about which human pressed which keys? Penmanship isn't engineering. I don't want to nurse my code. I want to build things.

      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The decisions
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        384 documented technical decisions in uroboro. Each one follows the format: what I chose, what I rejected, why. "Zero external dependencies over convenience libraries &mdash; control and auditability." "SQLite over Postgres &mdash; single file, no daemon, portable." "CLI-first over web UI &mdash; composable, scriptable, no browser dependency."
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        That format isn't something a vibe-coder does. You don't record what you rejected if you never considered alternatives. The decision trail shows deliberate choices with trade-offs weighed. Across 54 projects. Across multiple programming languages and problem domains.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        But. The formal tagging only started in January 2026. Seven weeks of discipline, not nine months. Before that, uroboro captured raw notes &mdash; verbose, untagged, useful for archaeology but not for analysis. The June 2025 data is 586 captures from building uroboro itself, which is recursive in a way that makes the data unreliable. (Building the measurement tool generates measurement artifacts. Who knew.)
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        What the decisions do show, even in seven weeks: patterns that recur across unrelated projects. Zero-dependency preference in Go, in bash, in site architecture. SQLite as the coordination layer everywhere. CLI-first interfaces even when a web UI would be easier to demo. These aren't AI defaults. Claude would happily reach for Express or React or whatever fits. These are human preferences the AI learned to follow.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        15 blockers. 12 open questions. The blocker count is suspiciously low &mdash; either I rarely get stuck or I rarely bother to record it. Knowing myself: the second one.

        The approval rate
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I built <a href="https://github.com/QRY91/keygrave" style="color: var(--color-accent)">keygrave</a> as a satirical shitpost. A fake corporate telemetry enrollment screen that parses your actual Claude Code session data and outputs real numbers dressed in dystopian aesthetics. "You are the product. Thank you for your participation. This data has not been transmitted. (That you know of.)" The whole point is to embody the short-sighted conclusions people jump to based on arbitrary data.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        And the numbers are perfect for jumping to conclusions.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        29,038 approvals. Zero rejections. 288 sessions, 43 projects, 1.1 gigabytes of conversation data. Of those 29,038 approvals, 29,009 were automatic tool accepts. Only 29 times did I type an actual response to a tool request. 94.3% of my inputs are functionally pressing a single key. Keygrave calls it "CCK-3 Compatibility" &mdash; as in, how compatible are you with <a href="/fun/claudetite-keyz/" style="color: var(--color-accent)">Claudetite Keyz</a>, the satirical three-key keyboard. Average time between Claude's output and my next input: 7.6 seconds.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        So that's damning, right? Mindless rubber-stamping. A human reduced to a permission re-approver.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Or &mdash; and this is what keygrave is actually satirizing &mdash; those numbers measure the friction of a permission system, not the quality of the work being approved. I could run with the dangerous flags and make the approval count drop to zero. Would that make me a better engineer or a worse one? The approval isn't the decision. It's a speed bump left over from a trust model that hasn't caught up with the workflow. I'm babysitting re-confirmations, not rubber-stamping output. There's a difference, but the metric can't see it.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        That's what makes keygrave work as satire. The numbers are real. The conclusion people want to draw from them is bullshit. Same data. Different priors. "Real programmers use a magnetized needle and a steady hand."
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        The pattern
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The 384 decisions and the 29,038 approvals aren't contradictions. They're two layers of the same workflow. The decisions happen at the architectural level &mdash; what to build, which patterns to follow, what trade-offs to accept. The approvals happen at the execution level &mdash; write this file, run this command, make this edit. I think at one altitude. The AI executes at another. I don't say no at the execution level because by the time it's executing, the decision already happened.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        This is how every tool relationship works. A carpenter doesn't deliberate each hammer strike. A driver doesn't rethink the steering wheel at every curve. The trust was earned through use, not through blind faith. But measure the hammer strikes per hour without that context and you'll conclude the carpenter is a mindless hammering machine. Keygrave measures hammer strikes.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The data tells whatever story you want it to tell. 948 commits says "productive" or "AI-inflated" depending on your priors. 94.3% says "surrendered agency" or "efficient workflow" depending on whether you think re-approving tool permissions is meaningful cognitive work. The cyclical pattern says "inconsistent" or "human" depending on whether you've ever met a person.

        The actual question
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Am I a hyperresponder? Wrong question. The right question is: does it matter who typed the code?
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        We work in the automation industry. We build systems that replace manual labor with machine precision. We celebrate when a deploy pipeline eliminates human toil. We write infrastructure-as-code so no one has to click buttons in a console. And then we turn around and fetishize hand-written code like it's artisanal sourdough. Hand-written code doesn't just oversell human authorship &mdash; it undersells human fallibility. In an industry that seeks to scale to infinity, "I typed every character myself" is not the flex people think it is.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Anti-precious. Build it, break it, recompose it. <a href="/steampunk-engineering/" style="color: var(--color-accent)">Junkyard mindset</a>. The value isn't in the keystrokes. It's in the decisions &mdash; what to build, why, and what to throw away. Those are in the uroboro log. The keystrokes are in the git log. One of those is the work. The other is the artifact of the work.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        948 commits. 384 decisions. 29,038 permission re-approvals. The data is here. It'll confirm whatever you already believe.
