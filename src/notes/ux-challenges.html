            Name for the Elden Ring / Monster Hunter comparison: <strong>UX Challenges</strong> (literally).
            How the UX of these games impacts their gameplay and their perceived difficulty.
        </p>

        <p>
            Look at inputs required for essential actions like healing or mounting. Think about
            human hands doing the inputs on controllers. Elden Ring claw grip contortions.
            QoL stuff like quick actions and customizable keybinds.

        <h2>The "intentional" defense</h2>

            "It's intentional."

        <p>
            Then the intention is to make the controls uncomfortable, rather than providing
            challenging gameplay encounters. Wrangling the systems IS part of the fun, it
            should not be part of the friction. That's cheap ragebait.

        <p>
            Let me flow through combat like MonHun in Elden Ring, but fix all the issues
            MonHun has (mounted sprint claw contortions with no customizability).

        <h2>The dual meaning</h2>
        <p>
            UX Challenges: the player is challenged by UX, and also "UX Challenges" as in
            the difficulties in getting it right, and obvious flaws in existing titles.
