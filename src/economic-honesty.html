            The tech industry runs on a simple dynamic: most people know the current trends
            are varying degrees of insane, but economic leverage determines intellectual freedom.
            Until you have "fuck you" money, you nod along with "AI will revolutionize everything"
            while quietly building actual useful tools.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is for everyone who's ever sat in a meeting thinking "this is completely insane"
            while nodding because they need health insurance.

        <h2>The meta layer</h2>
        <p>
            Even this observation gets commodified. The critique of capitalism becomes a product
            (satirical merch, anyone?). We're simultaneously victims and perpetrators. That's
            not hypocrisy - it's just the water we swim in.
        </p>

        <p>
            Acknowledging economic constraints isn't defeat. It's starting from reality instead
            of pretending you're operating from some principled high ground that doesn't exist.
