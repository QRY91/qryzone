        I type Dvorak on a split keyboard with blank keycaps. The firmware is custom QMK running on dual ATmega32U4s &mdash; four layers, fixed-point physics, a custom I2C message protocol with checksums and sequence numbers. I built a distributed Pong game across the two halves because I had spare cycles on the microcontrollers and couldn't not. Current firmware uses 73% of available flash.

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Then I open Claude Code and press 1.

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Approve. Approve. Approve. The entire input surface of an agentic workflow is a numbered list. My right hand does nothing. Half the keyboard &mdash; the half I soldered &mdash; is scenery.

        The contradiction
      </h2>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        There's a contradiction here that I find genuinely interesting, not just funny. I care about input. I care about the physical interface between my hands and the machine. I moved to Dvorak because the default layout was an accident of typewriter mechanics. I moved to a split board because the default form factor was an accident of manufacturing cost. I use blank keycaps because the labels were for a layout I don't use. Every choice is deliberate. Every choice is mine.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        And then the workflow says: pick a number.
      </p>

        What happens before the number
      </h2>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        But here's what the workflow doesn't say: what happened before the number.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Before I press 1, I've read the diff. Not the summary &mdash; the diff. I've written test specs that define what "correct" means before the agent touches a line of code. I've built a Go CLI called <a href="https://www.uroboro.dev/">uroboro</a> that captures every architectural decision into a local SQLite database so the next session has context for why the last session made the choices it did. I built <a href="https://github.com/QRY91/wherewasi">another tool</a> that reconstructs session context from git history because the expensive human judgment isn't typing &mdash; it's knowing what to type and whether what came back is right.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Last June I deleted 10,250 lines in a single commit. Everything an AI had generated over two and a half weeks of feature sprawl &mdash; a tamagotchi system, a sensei, a voice analyzer, analytics, vector search. Twelve features that did everything and nothing. I <a href="/disassemble-recombine/">stripped it back</a> to what it actually did, preserved the experimental branch like a specimen in a jar, and rebuilt three separate tools from the wreckage. The code died. The thinking lived.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I've written <a href="/steampunk-engineering/">at length</a> about the difference between rubber-stamp approval and actual human oversight. The pattern that works: Human decides <em>what</em> and <em>why</em>, automation handles <em>how</em>. The pattern that doesn't: Human &rarr; AI &rarr; Decision &rarr; Action. That's not assistance, that's replacement. The numbered list looks identical in both cases. The difference is invisible to anyone watching your hands.

        The satire
      </h2>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I wrote <a href="/fun/claudetite-keyz/">a satire piece about this</a> &mdash; a three-key keyboard for approval-based development. It's a product page for a keyboard that does the only thing the workflow <em>appears</em> to ask of you. It escalates through a Pro model and then an Ultra that routes your keypresses through a datacenter for inference, because if you're already outsourcing the code, why not outsource the keystroke.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        It's a joke, but the thing underneath it isn't. The keyboard I <a href="/lily58-gaming/">actually built</a> is an expression of a value: that the interface matters, that the tool should fit the hand, that defaults are worth questioning. The agentic loop doesn't disagree with that value &mdash; it just makes it irrelevant to one specific <em>moment</em> of programming. The approval moment. And that moment is the smallest part of the work, even though it's the most visible.

        The iceberg
      </h2>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The 58 keys aren't for the approval. They're for everything around it &mdash; writing the specs, reading the diffs, drafting the prompts, editing the output, building the tools that make the approval mean something instead of nothing. The 1 is the tip. The keyboard is the iceberg.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        I don't think this is a problem to solve. It's a tension to sit with. But it's not the tension I thought it was when I started writing this. The contradiction isn't between caring about input and having trivial input. It's between what the workflow <em>looks like</em> and what the workflow <em>is</em>. From the outside, I press 1. From the inside, the 1 is the least interesting keystroke of the day.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        But it is funny that I mass-flash custom firmware onto a hand-soldered microcontroller so I can press it more comfortably.
