# Hello World, from QRY.zone!

Welcome to my new digital corner. This is where I, Q, will be "yapping about obscure interests."

## What to Expect

Lots of learning in public, probably some awkward moments, but hopefully some genuine insights too. We'll be diving into:

- Shader experiments (Verve will be busy!)
- Deep dives into web technologies
- Thoughts on creative coding and process (Terra's wisdom, perhaps?)

Stay tuned. Questions mandatory!
