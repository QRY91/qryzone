        Kintsugi fills cracks with gold instead of hiding them. The repair becomes part of the object's history. The bowl is more interesting for having broken.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is written with AI assistance and then edited by hand. Sometimes the edits happen on publication day. Sometimes months later, when a word that seemed fine starts to grate. The corrections below are the gold lines &mdash; visible repairs where something was wrong and got fixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of these are <a href="/antislop-editorial/">de-slopping</a> passes: replacing words and patterns that leak through AI-assisted drafting. Vague headings that gesture at meaning without providing it. Filler phrases that pad sentences. Overused words that make everything sound the same.

        February 2026 &mdash; the big pass
      </h2>
      <p>
        37 files. 150 lines changed. After building the <a href="/slopsquid-technical-preset/">SlopSquid technical preset</a>
        and writing about <a href="/antislop-editorial/">de-slopping in practice</a>,
        it felt dishonest not to turn the detector on the rest of the site. Here's what it found.
      </p>

      <h3>Vague headings replaced with specific ones</h3>

      <h2>Why publish this</h2>
      <p>
        Writing with AI means accepting that some percentage of what gets published will have a machine fingerprint on it. You can pretend otherwise, or you can make the corrections visible. The repairs are the proof you're paying attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page will grow as more corrections happen. That's the point. A site that never needs corrections either isn't being read or isn't being honest.
