            I got into the software industry with the intention of using my powers for good.
            I enjoy the privilege of having a decent head on my shoulders, and I can use it
            to benefit humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Morally, I find it difficult to tolerate the callous remarks of profit-driven minds
            in the space, the dreaded tech-bro mindset. It's abhorrent, and through my silence,
            I become complicit.
