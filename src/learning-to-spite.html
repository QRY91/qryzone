            "I learn to spite those who punish it. If I can suffer and learn and build systems
            that prevent others from experiencing that dysfunction, then the suffering becomes
            valuable. If I die with the knowledge, the systems never get built, and the
            dysfunction repeats."

        <p>
            Bad experiences with institutions - education that punished curiosity, workplaces
            that valued compliance over competence, systems that extracted more than they gave.
            These leave marks.
        </p>

        <p>The question is what to do with them.</p>

        <h2>The reframe</h2>
        <p>
            Spite is underrated as motivation. It's sustainable in ways that pure altruism
            isn't. "I will learn this thing specifically because someone said I couldn't"
            carries you through the 3am debugging sessions that "it would be nice to help
            people" doesn't.
        </p>

        <p>
            But spite alone is corrosive. The trick is combining it with documentation.
            Learn, build, then share so others don't have to suffer the same path.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dysfunction becomes data. The suffering becomes a case study.
            The spite fuels the work. The documentation makes it useful to others.

            Every tool I build comes from a specific frustration. Context gets lost between
            sessions - <a href="https://www.uroboro.dev/">uroboro</a>. Systems require too much from the user - local-first design.
            Corporate software treats users as products - privacy-respecting alternatives.
