        The graveyard problem
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Traditional portfolios are graveyards of finished work. Here's what I shipped. Look how clean. Next.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        But that's not how development actually works. The interesting part happens in the middle &mdash; debugging at 2am, refactoring something three times, realizing your architecture was wrong and starting over.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        This site is the experiment: what if the portfolio <em>was</em> the workshop? Willy Wonka's factory with philosophical undertones, but for software.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        What you see here
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The messy middle. Debugging logs turned into essays. Refactoring commits turned into methodology. Ideas that didn't work sitting right next to ideas that did, because the failures taught more.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Honest timelines. Nothing here was "built in a weekend." Some of it took months. The dates are real. The status labels (seedling, growing, evergreen) are real. You can watch things evolve.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Connecting patterns. One project leads to the next. A monitoring tool leads to a debugging essay leads to a style guide leads to a voice analysis. The portfolio isn't a list &mdash; it's a graph.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Building in public means showing the stuff you figured out that isn't in any tutorial. That's where actual connection happens. Not "look at my demo," but "here's what broke and here's what I learned."
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        Ideas I haven't built yet
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Ship an actual SQLite file with the site. Let people browse project ideas, half-baked concepts, tool notes. "Ideas are cheap. Take however many you want. If you build it before me, show me." That proves execution matters more than ideation, and invites people who actually build things.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        A PS1/PicoCAD style 3D diorama of the physical dev setup. Click on the keyboard, see the firmware repo. Click on the monitor, see the current project. Click on the coffee cup, get a 404.
      </p>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        Keeping it inhabited
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        AI helps write content on this site. I don't pretend otherwise. But the workshop has to feel like someone lives here.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        That means the slang stays. The humor stays. The lowercase stays. The profanity stays when it earns its place. Perfect prose is suspicious &mdash; it signals "generated and not reviewed" faster than any watermark.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Failures stay too. The stuff that broke, the ideas that went nowhere, the architectures that collapsed under their own weight. A workshop with only finished pieces isn't a workshop. It's a showroom.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom: var(--space-xxl)">
      <h2 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-md); color: var(--color-accent); font-family: var(--font-mono)">
        Why this might work
      </h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Process is more interesting than product. Most portfolios show what you built. Few show how you think.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Transparency builds trust. Not the marketing kind. The "I can see your git history and your half-finished ideas and you're clearly a real person" kind.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        Sites that change attract people who like watching things grow. That's a good filter for the kind of collaborators you actually want.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md)">
        The site evolves like software. That's the point. Static portfolios die. Living workshops change as you do.
      </p>

        Showing the messy work creates better connections than showing the polished results. We'll see if it works.
